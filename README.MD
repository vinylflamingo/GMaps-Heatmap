Hello!

This projects takes a data set of false alarms. It uses two google APIs. 
One to first transcribe the set of addresses into Longitute and Latitude.
The second api is used to generate the map from the set of coordinates.
You can open map_NewOrleans.html to get an idea of how the final render may look.
